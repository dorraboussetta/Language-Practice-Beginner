## Alerts System Application

This program is a practice problem implemented in C. It simulates a basic alerts management system where personnel can log in and perform actions based on their assigned role.

### Description

The application stores personnel information and a list of alerts. After logging in, a user receives a role-specific menu and can interact with the alert system. The program continues running until a user chooses to quit.

### Features

- Add new alerts  
- Display all alerts  
- Modify an alert  
- Delete an alert  
- Calculate the percentage of alerts in a specified zone  
- Role-based menus for agents and administrators  
- Continuous program execution until the user exits  

### What I practiced through this program

- **Using functions in C** to organize program logic  
- **Working with structures** to store personnel and alert data  
- **Managing arrays of structures** and passing them to functions  
- **Using loops to control overall program flow**, allowing multiple users to operate the application until someone chooses to quit  
- **Separating code into multiple files** (`main.c`, `function.c`, `header.h`)  
- **Implementing search, modification, and deletion operations** inside arrays
