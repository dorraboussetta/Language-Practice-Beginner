# Train Management Program (Linked List Practice)

This C console application simulates the management of a train using a **singly linked list**.  

Each wagon (including the locomotive) is represented as a node dynamically allocated in memory.  
The program allows the user to build and manage a train interactively through a menu-driven interface.

This project is intended as a practice exercise for:

- Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`)
- Linked list manipulation
- Structures and pointers in C
- Basic search and traversal algorithms
- Menu-based program design
