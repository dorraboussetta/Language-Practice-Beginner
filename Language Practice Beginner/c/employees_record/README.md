# Employee File Management Program

## Overview

This C program manages employee records using a text file.  
Each employee has a first name, last name, and number of children.  
The program allows the user to:

- Add employee records to a file
- Search for an employee by first name
- Filter employees based on number of children
- Delete employees who meet a specific condition (e.g., zero children)

All data is stored in a text file (`number_of_children.txt`), and file operations are performed using standard C file handling functions.



## Concepts Practiced

This program is designed to practice:

- File handling in C (`fopen`, `fclose`, `fprintf`, `fscanf`)
- Searching records in a file
- Filtering file content
- Deleting records using a temporary file


The program reinforces understanding of how structured data can be stored, read, modified, and managed in external files using C.
