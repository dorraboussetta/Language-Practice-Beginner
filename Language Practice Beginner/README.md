# 🧠 Beginner Language Practice


This repository is a collection of practice exercises and mini-projects that I complete while learning different programming languages. It serves as a personal sandbox to strengthen my foundational skills and track my learning progress.

## 📌 Purpose

- Practice syntax, logic, and core programming concepts
- Document my journey as I explore multiple languages
- Keep exercises separate from full projects

## 🧪 What's Included

- ✨ **Python** (in progress)
  - Practice scripts
  - Mini-projects 
- 🛠️ **More languages coming soon**
  - C, C++, JavaScript, SQL, R, etc.
  - Each with its own folder and practice sets

> 📁 **Note:** Full projects will have their own dedicated repositories. This repo is specifically for small-scale, language-learning tasks.
