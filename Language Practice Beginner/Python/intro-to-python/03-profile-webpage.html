"""Fills in an HTML template with user data to construct a custom webpage."""

# Collect user profile data.

# Construct a personalized page header for the logged in user.
header_title = "<h1>" + first_name + "'s profile</h1>"
header_subtitle = "<h2>Hello, " + first_name + "!</h2>"
header_content = "<p>" + email + "</p>"
header_content2 = "<p>" + first_name + "'s birth date: " + birth_date + "</p>"
