# 🐍 Python Beginner Practice Projects

This folder contains my Python practice exercises and mini-projects.

## 📂 Contents

Each subfolder is organized by topic:

- `intro-to-python/`: Basic concepts such as print statements, data types, and simple expressions.  
- `conditionals/`: Designing algorithms using conditional logic.  
- `functions/`: Creating and calling functions.  
- `lists/`: Creating, iterating through, and modifying lists.  
- `loops/`: Practicing Python loop structures like `for` and `while`.

> 📁 **Note:** Full-scale projects will have their own dedicated repositories.  
> This folder is specifically for small-scale, Python-learning tasks.
