# Python Beginner Practice Projects

This folder contains my Python practice projects as I learn the basics of coding.

Each folder is organized by topic:
- `intro-to-python/`: basic concepts such as print statements, data types, and simple expressions
- `logic/`: if/else practice (e.g., calculator, number guessing)

## Why This Exists
This repo is a learning journal. I’m building habits early by using GitHub to track everything I practice — even small projects.

## Next Steps
As I grow, I’ll add more challenges and mini-projects.
