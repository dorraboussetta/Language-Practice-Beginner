# Heart Rates Analysis

This is a challenge from Khan Academy. I was given the starter program [starter program](https://tinyurl.com/c6yfs2ut), and then I was asked to **complete it**.

This program analyzes and interprets heart rates data based on the user's age. The program analyzes:

- Total resting time
- Total time spent exercising
- The time when the heart rate reached its peak
- How long the longest deep sleep lasted

The included data covers 3 days, but the program is designed to handle more. 


## 📁 Files

- `main.py`: Runs the main logic for the heart rates interpretation.
- `metrics.py`: Contains the functions that analyze the data.
- `heart_rates.py`: Contains the the heart rates data sets

## 📝 My Contributions

- in `main.py`:
  - Wrote the days list and the for loop that controls which dataset is analyzed
  - Created the age and day variables
  - Wrote the logic that selects the correct heart rate data for each day (e.g., if day == "Sunday": heart_rates = sunday_data)
    
- Wrote the **function bodies only** for most functions in `metrics.py`  (The function headers and docstrings were provided by the instructor)  
- Specifically, I completed all functions in `metrics.py` *except* `get_max_heart_rate` and `convert_index_to_time`  
- Wrote the `get_age` function
- `heart_rates.py` was fully provided by the instructor



## 🎯 Purpose

- Practicing **list** iterations
- This project reinforces analyzing structured data using iteration and logic.


## ✅ What I Learned

- Improved my skills in iterating over structured data (lists of heart rates)
- Learned how to debug logical errors and test functions


## 🔜 What's Next

- String manipulation
