# Python Beginner Practice Projects

This repository contains my Python practice projects as I learn the basics of coding.

Each folder is organized by topic:
- `logic/`: if/else practice (e.g., calculator, number guessing)
- `loops/`: for/while loop projects (e.g., multiplication table, Fibonacci)
- `strings/`: string manipulation (e.g., palindrome checker)
- `functions/`: reusable functions (e.g., BMI calculator)
- `files/`: reading and writing files

## Why This Exists
This repo is a learning journal. I’m building habits early by using GitHub to track everything I practice — even small projects.

## Next Steps
As I grow, I’ll add more challenges and mini-projects.
