# DNA Mutation Simulation

This is a challenge from Khan Academy. I was given the starter program in this [link](https://tinyurl.com/3x95u8e8), and then I was asked to **refactor and complete it**.

This program simulates a random mutation event in a short DNA sequence.

- Mutations are **more likely** to occur at the **beginning and end** of the sequence.
- Each mutation replaces a base with a **different** one (no repeats).
- The replacement favors **chemically similar bases**  
  (purines ↔ purines, pyrimidines ↔ pyrimidines).


## 📁 Files

- `main.py`: Runs the mutation simulation and displays the original and mutated sequence.
- `dna.py`: Contains the mutation logic with **weighted base replacement**.


## 🎯 Purpose

- Practice creating and working with **lists**
- Accessing and replacing **elements** in a list


## ✅ What I Learned

- How to **create and manipulate lists**
- How to **access and replace** specific list elements
- How to use `random.choices()` with weights


## 🔜 What's Next

- Looping through lists using **iteration**
