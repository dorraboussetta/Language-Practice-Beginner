# Avatar Generator 🎭

This program is a challenge from Khan Academy.  
I was given 5 lines of starter code and asked to complete the program.

It uses a module called `avatar.py` (originally written by the instructor) to display a simple, text-based avatar with different facial features.

> ℹ️ The `avatar.py` module and the first five lines of `main.py` were written by Kim Merrill from Khan Academy.  
> I’ve included them here with credit, as part of my solution to this practice challenge: [Avatar Generator Challenge](https://tinyurl.com/bddftnf7).

## 🧠 What the Program Does

The program lets 1 or 2 players generate avatars by selecting (or randomly assigning):

- A **nose shape** (`button` or `triangle`)
- A **mouth shape** (`smile`, `neutral`, or `teeth`)
- A **bow location** (`forehead`, `neck`, or none)

The second player can choose their own avatar or get random attributes — while ensuring no duplicate nose shapes between the two.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Learn how to use the `random` module:
  - `random.randint`
  - `random.choice`
- Practice using external modules (`avatar.py`)
- Practice user input handling and conditionals

---

## ✅ What I Learned

- How to use `random.randint()` and `random.choice()`
- How to build logic that avoids duplicate traits
- How to use functions from an external module

---

## 🔜 What’s Next

- Learning more about `loops`
- Creating and organizing functions
- Refactoring this program to remove repeated code
